# Pet App Back-End 

## Project Description
Famous German-American writer Charles Bukowski said, “When I am feeling low, all I have to do is watch my cats and my courage returns.” 
All through the years, pets have been a favorite companion of humans. 
Pets are found to reduce mental illnesses such as stress, anxiety, increase happiness, and improve physical health.
Although we enjoy the companionship of our pets, sometimes it’s not possible for us to dedicate some time for them in our calendar.
On the other hand some people might have more free time but not a pet to spend time with.
So it can be a great idea if people who are eager to spend some time with our pets and 
use their mental support and also have the required time and energy for it, 
would take care of our pet for our vacation week or take our pet out for a walk or take them to vet appointments for us and etc.   

This project is intended to provide a general application for pets owners or pet lovers!

The needed tools and features of the project:
- An environment for people to express their needs and ask for help.
- An environment for pet shops to register their shops and provide their business an online platform.
- An environment for vets to register themselves and pet owners getting online consultations. 
- Providing notifications and reminders to pet owners such as buying food, or time for walking, vet check-up appointments, etc. 
- Providing notifications to pet lovers about appropriate requests based on their free time (in their calendar) and their interests and preferences.
